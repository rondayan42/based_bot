# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** January 28, 2026

## 1. Agreement to Terms

By inviting the **Based Bot** ("Bot") to a Discord server or using its features (including but not limited to the `!mybased`, `!leaderboard`, or `based/cringe` tracking commands), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Bot.

You also agree to comply with Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). You also verify that you have read and agree to our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md).

## 2. Description of Service

The Bot provides a fun, gamified system for tracking "based" and "cringe" counts and storing short text snippets called "pills" associated with users. The Bot operates on the Discord platform.

## 3. User Conduct

You are responsible for your use of the Bot and for any content ("pills") you generate. By using the Bot, you agree **NOT** to:

*   Use the Bot to generate, store, or promote content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or hateful.
*   Use the Bot to harass or bully other users.
*   Spam the Bot's commands or attempt to disrupt its operation.
*   Exploit bugs or glitches in the Bot for unfair advantage.

The Bot Owner reserves the right to blacklist any user or server from using the Bot for violation of these Terms.

## 4. Data Privacy & Usage

To function, the Bot collects and stores specific data:

*   **User IDs**: To uniquely identify users and associate scores with them.
*   **Usernames**: May be temporarily fetched to display on leaderboards or profiles.
*   **User-Generated Content**: The text content of "pills" you create (e.g., `based and [content] pilled`) is stored in the database linked to the target user's ID.

This data is stored solely for the purpose of the Bot's core functionality (tracking scores and pills). We do not sell or share this data with third parties. For more details, please refer to our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md).

## 5. Termination & Data Removal

You may stop using the Bot at any time. If you wish to have your data (scores and pills) removed from the Bot's database, please contact the Bot Owner directly.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Bot is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. The Bot Owner does not guarantee that the Bot will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the Bot Owner be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the Bot.

## 8. Updates to Terms

We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Bot after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
