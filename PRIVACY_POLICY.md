# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 28, 2026

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how **Based Bot** ("we", "our", or "Bot") collects, uses, and stores your information. By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and usage of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1. Automatically Collected Information
When you interact with the Bot, we automatically collect specific data necessary for functionality:
*   **Discord User ID**: A unique numeric identifier associated with your Discord account.
*   **Discord Server ID**: The ID of the server where the interaction occurred (if applicable for server-specific settings).

### 2.2. User-Generated Content ("Pills")
We collect and store text content that you explicitly accept to associate with a user by using the "pill" system (e.g., replying with `based and [content] pilled`).
*   **Pill Content**: The text string captured from your message.
*   **Association**: This text is linked to the User ID of the recipient.

### 2.3. Message Content
The Bot processes message content to checks for commands (e.g., `!mybased`, `based`) and to extract "pills".
*   **Storage**: Message content is **NOT** stored permanently, except for the specific "pill" text segments described in 2.2.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:
*   **Core Functionality**: To track and display "based" counts, "cringe" counts, and lists of "pills" for users.
*   **Leaderboards**: To rank users based on their counts.
*   **Profile Display**: To show your stats and pills when requested via commands.

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

*   **Storage Location**: Data is stored in a SQLite database hosted on servers provided by **Wispbyte.com**.
*   **Retention Period**: We retain User IDs, counts, and pills indefinitely to maintain your stats and history within the Bot.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others.

**Hosting Provider**: Our bot is hosted on **Wispbyte.com**. While data resides on their infrastructure as a service provider, they do not access or use user data for their own purposes.

## 6. Access and Control

To request a copy of your data or to request deletion of your data (scores and pills), please contact the Bot Owner directly via Discord. 

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Continued use of the Bot after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the new policy.
